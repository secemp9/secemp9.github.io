So here's the thing. I'm making this blog because I keep finding myself having to explain how I think (surprisingly). Not because people ask directly, but because it comes up. Someone doesn't understand something, or they believe something I don't, and I can't just explain my intuition. The only thing that comes to mind is explaining my entire thinking process from scratch. So now I can just send them this link instead.

The way I think isn't some grand theory. It's more like a muscle that formed over time. Not planned, just...life happening. Through desperation, through living, through everything. You just can't help but think, and this is the result.

Before I could articulate any of this, I used to just think in vibes. You know the usual, gut feelings, instincts, whatever you want to call it. But at some point I realized that wasn't enough. I needed something I could actually explain to people without sounding completely schizo.

## Scaling

The closest real-world term I can find for it is [Bayesian thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference). Not exactly the same, but similar. The spirit of it matches what I do. Internally, through vibes, I just scale how I think. SCALE. Not really like [MCTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) - that would be insane to actually do - but it's kinda like that? I like to call it mind simulation.

Basically, I scale how much wrong and right I could be, and why, and then act based on that. Not in concrete percentages - that would be a pain to keep track of and wouldn't scale. I think in abstract probabilities. Dynamic ones. Some are static, but there's always a reason when they are, and when they're not, they can remain malleable enough that I can do whatever I want with them. Abstract yet dynamic. You get what I'm saying.

The goal isn't to be right. It's to be wrong ***faster***. Scaling being wrong and right such that next time, I'm hopefully converging on the optimal outcome. And if I end up actually really wrong? I just update my priors and do it again. That's it. That's the whole thing.

Or I could draw it - picture me as a circle, with two arrows going outward, left and right. Wrong and right. Then more arrows branching from each end. States. Possible states. Wait, I already did that earlier. [image]

Come to think of it, this is basically a [world model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DokLw1tILlw). You know, like the ones [LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun) talks about. Same idea, I just do it through vibes instead of gradients.

I talked to a friend once and he basically admitted he thinks in second-order effects. You know, thinking about the consequences of the consequences. That's cool. (new word unlocked!) But when I explained how I think, he was like "oh yeah, that's a step up, it's Nth order effect." I don't really like that word though, it feels reductive. I prefer saying I take context into account. Which contexts? How much context? I don't know, I mean, I would know, but I don't know how to define it for other people.

This shows up a lot when I'm reasoning about ideas. Having good ideas - novel ones that actually push the needle in some worthwhile direction - is the easiest part for me. Always has been. The hardest part is execution speed, but even that has become less of a problem these days. What it really depends on is how fast you can test your ideas. And that comes down to compute. The more you have, the more you can ablate, sweep, test and update your priors. Ideas to me are unfounded knowledge. Unverified, unknown. It doesn't matter. Think of it as an abstract blob floating in space. What matters is that you can scale it.

## Lines in Sand

That same friend I mentioned earlier once told me I need a line drawn in the sand. What he meant was, don't let this way of thinking spill over into everything, otherwise no one understands you. And I get that. But what he didn't get is that while I do think very flexibly - which I also like to call pragmatic optimism, where I believe everything could work based on past events, without ignoring impossibility - I do know when to rein it in.

This way of thinking works great for me. But it's not something I'd ever show to the world. Not because it's wrong, but because it's messy. It's chaotic. If I were doing serious work that requires scientific rigor, I'd keep this internal—except, well, this blog. Externally, I'd show the refined version. The version where I have concrete evidence and reproducibility. Until I have that, it stays internal or gets presented as theoretical grounding, nothing more.

---

The hard part is that this way of thinking doesn't translate well. It's like trying to describe a color to someone who's never seen it. I can describe it, but you can't really understand it unless you're running my world model. And even reading this, you're probably thinking I'm some kind of lunatic. Take it with a grain of salt either way.

So yeah. That's how I think. I don't think it's the right way to think. It's probably overkill. But it gives me the kind of critical thinking I need. And maybe it'll work for someone else too, or maybe you'll just understand why I am the way I am. Either way, at least now we both know.
