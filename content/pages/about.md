Hi, I'm secemp/secemp9.

I'm an independent researcher interested in everything ML, CS, and Math (and related fields).

Thinking outside the box? I like to think there *is* no box. Pragmatic optimistic.

Chaotic-minded, but striving for order.

## Current Focus

Currently in my exploratory-to-exploitation phase.

Here you'll find notes, experiments, and projects, mostly about ML.

I like the number 9 (which can be generalized to all odd numbers), but really, I just like numbers in general.
