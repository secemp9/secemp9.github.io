  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm secemp/secemp9.<br>
    I'm an independent researcher interested in everything ML, CS, and Math (and related fields).<br>
    <br>
    Thinking outside the box? I like to think there *is* no box.<br>
    <br>
    Chaotic-minded, but striving for order.<br>
    <br>
    Currently in my exploratory-to-exploitation phase.<br>
    Here you'll find notes, experiments, and projects, mostly about ML.<br>
    I like the number 9 (which can be generalized to all odd numbers), but really, I just like numbers in general.
