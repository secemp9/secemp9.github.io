    Hi, I'm secemp/secemp9.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    I'm an independent researcher interested in everything ML, CS, and Math (and related fields).

  </p>

  

  <h2>Philosophy</h2>

  

  <p>

    Thinking outside the box? I like to think there <em>is</em> no box.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    Chaotic-minded, but striving for order.

  </p>

  

  <h2>Current Focus</h2>

  

  <p>

    Currently in my exploratory-to-exploitation phase.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    Here you'll find notes, experiments, and projects, mostly about ML.

  </p>

  

  <h2>Random</h2>

  

  <p>

    I like the number 9 (which can be generalized to all odd numbers), but really, I just like numbers in general.
